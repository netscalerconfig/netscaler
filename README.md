# NetScaler batch generation Python Library

When loaded, this librar will offer access to a class that allows creation of NetScaler config files. This library will validate most configurations before generating the config file.

## Functions

* _NetScaler.add_lb_vserver(name, servicetype, IPAddress, port, Attributes)_

    Will create a LB vServer of type "servicetype" using IPAddress and Port. 
    ServiceType must match one of NetScaler's types. Please refer to NetScaler documentation
    This library will check that the IPAddress and port tuple is not used in the same config before. If so, it will generate an exception.

* NetScaler.add_server(name, IPAddress, Attributes)
    Will create a server. Checks of duplicate IP addresses will be done before registering the object in the config.

* NetScaler.add_service(name, server, servicetype, port, Attributes)
    Will create a service. Will check for duplicate names. Also, if the service is created with an IP address of a server previously defined, will generate an exception. Library will also check if service being created is referencing a server name that was not previously created and generate an exception. If the service references an IP address and the server doesn't exist, it will create it automatically.

* NetScaler.add_cs_action(name, Attributes)
    Will create a content switch action. Name duplicates will generate an exception. If the action is created with 'targetLBVserver' attribute, the existence of the lb vserver referenced is checked, if it doesn't exist the library will generate an exception.
    The accepted attributes are based on NetScaler firmware version 12.0. Attributes accepted must be of the form of a Dictionary and the keys are case sensitive. For documentation of each attribute please use NetScaler documentation. The list of accepted keys is:

* NetScaler.add_cs_policy(name, Attributes)
    Will create a content switch policy. Name duplicates will generate an exception. The 'action' attribute is optional, but recommended. This library has been created with "Advanced Expressions" in mind. At lease one of the 'domain', 'url' or 'rule' attributes must exist.
    The accepted attributes are based on NetScaler firmware version 12.0. Attributes accepted must be of the form of a Dictionary and the keys are case sensitive. For documentation of each attribute please use NetScaler documentation. The list of accepted keys is:

        rule
        action

* NetScaler.bind_lbvserver_service(lb_name, svc_name, Attributes)
    Will bind a service with a lb vServer. This function will check for the existence of both objects. The only attribute accepted is 'weight'

* NetScaler.bind_lbvserver_servicegroup(lb_name, sg_name, Attributes)
    Will bind a servicegroup with an lb vServer. This function will check for the existence of both objects. The only attribute accepted is 'weight'

* NetScaler.bind_servicegroup_server(sg_name, srv_name, port, Attributes)
    Will bind a server with the servicegroup. If the server is called by name, the existence of the server is validates before the bind; if the server doesn't exist an exception is generated. If the server is called by IP and the server exists with a name different than the IP address, an exception is generated and if it doesn't exist, a server is created using the ip as name.

        state
        weight

* NetScaler.bind_cs_lbvserver(cs_name, lb_name, Attributes)
    Will bind the lb vserver as the default content switch behavior. The library will check for the existence of both objects, if one or both don't exist an exception will be generated. Attributes will be ignored.

* NetScaler.bind_cs_cspolicy(cs_name, cspol_name, Attributes)
    Will bind a content switch policy with a cs vserver. 'priority' attributes is mandatory and the same priority cannot be used on the same virtual server.
